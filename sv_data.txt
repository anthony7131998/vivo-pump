IHEPA serves to facilitate collaborations of UF researchers in large scale projects in the interdisciplinary area of Particle Physics and Astrophysics. Many of the Institute's participants are involved in national and international experiments, including the CDF experiment at FermiLab, the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) at Cornell University, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), the experiment searching for Gravitational Waves in space (LISA), the CMS experiment at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, the axion search at Livermore National Laboratory, search for cold dark matter particles (CDMS), and the MiniBooNE neutrino oscillation experiment at Fermilab. Small groups of researchers from UF have taken active roles in the primary activities of these experimental efforts. Their activities include designing and constructing new apparatus in collaboration with outside groups, developing major software components, carrying out data analysis and simulation, and providing large scale computing support for data reduction and simulation, a task for which we are particularly well equipped. The High Energy group is particularly active in development of the GRID technologies for distributed computing which will be used for data analysis in CMS, LIGO, and other experiments.	institute;thing;uf;agent;org

A modern GIS (Geographic Information System) and Remote Sensing laboratory containing a number of powerful workstations provides the core research facility for spatial analysis of data collected from Earth-observing remote sensing platforms and field studies. This technology facilitates study of both land use/land cover change and long-term climate change. The LUECI laboratories are open to all students and faculty who have interests in climate-environment-human interactions, and the centralized nature of these state-of-the-art facilities act to foster collaborative research among individuals from diverse disciplines.</p>	institute;thing;uf;agent;org

http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n7023310		Bridge Software Institute		http://bsi-web.ce.ufl.edu/			http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n1278118						<i>The Bridge Software Institute</i> (BSI) is headquartered at the University of Florida (UF) in Gainesville, Florida. It was established in January 2000 to oversee the development of bridge related software products at UF. The goals of the BSI include enhancement, maintenance, and dissemination of bridge software to address the increasing demands on the transportation industry. The BSI also anticipates the future needs of the nation-wide transportation community in the digital environment, by the development and promotion of the Data Interchange for Geotechnical and GeoEnvironmental Specialists (DIGGS) and the design of a corresponding DIGGS database. The BSI is also dedicated to providing technical assistance with the software under the Institute's auspices.  <p>We place particular emphasis on high fidelity computational modeling and its application in advancing the basic computational methods to tackle new scientific challenges on new generations of large scale bridge engineering problems. The thrust of institutional research activities is the development of powerful computational codes and their application to the solutions of large scale bridge engineering problems through inter-disciplinary research and development in collaboration with the Structural/Geotechnical Research Groups in the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida. One of the main strengths of the institute and one for which it is nationally recognized, is in nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis and its applications to solving large-scale extreme event problems.</p>  <p>Since 2003, the BSI has developed a robust database system that integrates the application of geotechnical engineering data and associated metadata which enables the construction of services in the digital environment. The FDOT Database System is now being used in large-scale implementations, with more applications under development. The BSI is also leading in the DIGGS project. DIGGS is a coalition of government agencies, universities and industry partners whose focus is on the creation and maintenance of an international data transfer standard for transportation related data. The coalition came into existence through coordination with the U.S. Federal Highway Administration who sponsored meetings and eventually formed the pooled fund study project.</p>  <p>This unique intellectual and creative combination of academia, government, and industry energizes the work of our faculty, staff, and our students. As BSI moves further into the 21st century, I expect the institute to continue to succeed and to produce new generations of robust engineering software and thus to provide reliable engineering resolution to the community of bridge engineering in the world.</p>	institute;thing;uf;agent;org

http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n8858863		Emerging Pathogens Institute		http://www.epi.ufl.edu/			http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n466117						Welcome to the Emerging Pathogens Institute  <p>The Emerging Pathogens Institute will fuse key disciplines to develop outreach, education, and research capabilities designed to preserve Florida&#8217;s health and economy, and to prevent or contain new and re-emerging diseases. EPI includes more than 150 faculty who self-identify as members of our multi-disciplinary organization.</p>  New and re-emerging diseases threaten Florida&#8217;s tourism, health and economy, which are particularly vulnerable due to the state&#8217;s mild climate and diverse agriculture. Weather patterns, commercial plant imports and annual global visitors, all have the potential to unsuspectingly carry pathogens from other countries into our state. The Emerging Pathogens Institute will fuse key disciplines to develop outreach, education, and research capabilities designed to preserve Florida&#8217;s health and economy, and to prevent or contain new and re-emerging diseases.The purpose:  <p>To establish an Emerging Pathogens Institute (EPI) by fusing signature disciplines at the University of Florida and creating opportunities for novel scientific interaction.</p>  The objectives:  <ul>  <li>Develop the research capability to be prepared to prevent and contain outbreaks of new diseases that threaten Florida. </li>  <li>Develop the teaching capability to train the next generation of scientists who will keep these pathogens at bay in the future. </li>  <li>Develop the outreach capability to educate the people of Florida on steps they can take to avoid human diseases as well as help our private sector avoid diseases that affect plants and animals. </li>  The problem:  <p>Florida's residents and its two major industries, agriculture and tourism, are threatened by new diseases that enter Florida including West Nile virus and citrus greening.&#160;Other diseases not yet in Florida are an even larger threat such as avian flu in humans and hoof and mouth disease in cattle. Florida's unique geography and climate require unique disease prevention and control strategies.</p>  Why is Florida particularly vulnerable?  <p>Florida's wide array of temperate, sub-tropical, tropical ecosystems and its diverse agriculture are particularly vulnerable to new pathogens that thrive in our mild climate.&#160;Recent hurricanes allow disease agents to appear and reappear from the Caribbean and Latin America simply by being wind-borne. Over 76 million tourists each year and commercial plant imports from around the world have the potential to unwittingly carry pathogens to our state from other countries.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  </ul>	institute;thing;uf;agent;org
