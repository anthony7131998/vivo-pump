http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n1278123		extensionunit;org;uf;agent;thing	Aquatic Animal Health					http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n237306						<p>Aquatic animal medicine is a young specialty of veterinary medicine that includes medical care of marine mammals, sea turtles, fishes and aquatic invertebrates. There are broad sub-specialties within aquatic medicine which include care of captive marine mammals, care of pet fishes, zoo and aquarium species, aquaculture medicine, and clinical research involving free-ranging aquatic species. Specialty training incorporates aspects of clinical medicine, wildlife health, environmental science and engineering.</p>  <p>Aquatic animal health specialization requires substantial training and experience beyond the four year veterinary degree, and may include graduate school, internships, and in some cases, residency training. Currently, there is a specialty certificate in aquatic medicine which can be earned through board certification by the <a href="http://www.aczm.org/aczmmain.html">American College of Zoological Medicine</a>. There is also a certificate in fish pathology which can be earned through the <a href="http://www.fisheries.org/units/fhs/certific.htm">American Fisheries Association</a>.</p>  <p>The aquatic animal health program at the University of Florida includes the marine mammal health program operated through the College of Veterinary Medicine and the <a href="http://150.176.130.202/">Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience</a>. It is funded by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Also included is a strong program in fish and aquaculture medicine which is run through the <a href="http://fishweb.ifas.ufl.edu/index.htm">Program in Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</a>, in the School of Forest Resources and Conservation.</p>  The aquatic animal health program has activities in all academic areas which are part of the University of Florida&rsquo;s land grant mission. Our unique teaching program offers <a href="http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/extension/aquatic/education/#aahc">certification</a> to veterinary students allowing them to pursue specialized training and clinical experience in aquatic animal health while still in veterinary school. Our <a href="http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/extension/aquatic/education/#degrees">graduate education program</a> provides training in marine mammal science and aquaculture health with opportunities available at both the M.S. and PhD level. We also offer a unique <a href="http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/extension/aquatic/education/#Residency">clinical residency program</a> which is fully accredited by the American College of Zoological Medicine. In addition, we offer opportunities for public education under the auspices of IFAS Cooperative Extension Service. These include evening seminars for the public, workshops for aquaculturists and pet fish hobbyists, a regional marine mammal conference which is offered every third year, and a full suite of continuing education <a href="http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/extension/aquatic/education/#courses">short courses</a> in both fish and marine mammal medicine. Finally, the aquatic animal health program has a strong <a href="http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/extension/aquatic/research/">research</a> area. Areas of excellence include Florida manatee research, emerging diseases, viral diseases, sea turtle pathology, and aquaculture medicine. A clinical program run by Dr. Mike Walsh includes response to stranded marine mammals as requested by colleagues, and several clinical contracts in the region. <a href="http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/extension/aquatic/support/#aquaculture">Diagnostic services</a> for aquaculture clients are available through the Program in Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences.
