# Unit Tests and Data for VIVO Pump

Test cases are in test_vivopump.py.  Test data are in files in the data folder.

Many of the cases use a synthetic graph named TestGraph and imported from `testgraph.py`

A few examples go to a "live" VIVO to get data.  Examples using `query_parms` are those that require a live VIVO 
with connection string, username and password to access.
