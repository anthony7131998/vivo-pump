# UF Pump Examples

These examples show actual configurations used at the University of Florida to maintain VIVO.

They require UF ontology extensions.

## Organizations

UF updates organizations as needed.  UF organizations are classified as UFEntity.  UF organizations are identified
using deptid, an 8 digit number with positional logic.  Each department may have more than one deptid. 

## People

UF adds people to its VIVO each week, based on a feed of position data from HR.  UF employees are identified by UFID,
a single, opaque, random, eight digit number.

## Positions

UF updates positions for people each week.  Positions are linked to people by UFID, and to UF organizations by
deptid (see above).
