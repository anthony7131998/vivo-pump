# Experimenting with GitBook

This is an experiment built using GitBook.  GitBook is a platform for editing and managing books that can be produced in PDF, HTML, mobi and other formats.  You write the text using Markdown.  You manage the text in a Git repo (here, the book is managed as a directory in the vivo-pump repo).  You produce the book using GitBook (http://gitbook.com)
