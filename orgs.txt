It was established in January 2000 to oversee the development of bridge related software products at UF. The goals of the BSI include enhancement, maintenance, and dissemination of bridge software to address the increasing demands on the transportation industry. The BSI also anticipates the future needs of the nation-wide transportation community in the digital environment, by the development and promotion of the Data Interchange for Geotechnical and GeoEnvironmental Specialists (DIGGS) and the design of a corresponding DIGGS database. The BSI is also dedicated to providing technical assistance with the software under the Institute's auspices.  <p>We place particular emphasis on high fidelity computational modeling and its application in advancing the basic computational methods to tackle new scientific challenges on new generations of large scale bridge engineering problems. The thrust of institutional research activities is the development of powerful computational codes and their application to the solutions of large scale bridge engineering problems through inter-disciplinary research and development in collaboration with the Structural/Geotechnical Research Groups in the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida. One of the main strengths of the institute and one for which it is nationally recognized, is in nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis and its applications to solving large-scale extreme event problems.</p>  <p>Since 2003, the BSI has developed a robust database system that integrates the application of geotechnical engineering data and associated metadata which enables the construction of services in the digital environment. The FDOT Database System is now being used in large-scale implementations, with more applications under development. The BSI is also leading in the DIGGS project. DIGGS is a coalition of government agencies, universities and industry partners whose focus is on the creation and maintenance of an international data transfer standard for transportation related data. The coalition came into existence through coordination with the U.S. Federal Highway Administration who sponsored meetings and eventually formed the pooled fund study project.</p>  <p>This unique intellectual and creative combination of academia, government, and industry energizes the work of our faculty, staff, and our students. As BSI moves further into the 21st century, I expect the institute to continue to succeed and to produce new generations of robust engineering software and thus to provide reliable engineering resolution to the community of bridge engineering in the world.</p>"		http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n70464		thing;program;uf;agent;org	International Trade Law Program					http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n466111								http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n70611	Gainesville	department;org;uf	Student Legal Services	32611-8505	https://www.studentlegalservices.ufl.edu/	368 J.

The aim is to produce independent basic and clinician scientist investigators who are capable of developing and sustaining top quality research programs studying cause, treatment and prevention of hypertension and associated cardiovascular injury using a wide range techniques. By introduction of the trainees to a wide range of scientific disciplines during the training period, we intend to produce young scientists capable of multidisciplinary research; essential for understanding a complex disease such as hypertension.</p>  <p>There is clear need for future hypertension researchers, given the epidemic of hypertension in the US with over 65 million adults known to have hypertension in 1999 to 2000. Further, hypertension is now the single major cause for a doctors visit or for prescription of medications. Given the fact that the population is living longer and becoming more obese, a rapid further increase in incidence of hypertension is anticipated (Fields et al.,Hypertension. 44:398-404, 2004). As blood pressure increases in middle and old age, there is a strong and direct relation to vascular (and overall) mortality. In fact the risk is present at blood pressures even below the cutoff for hypertension, 140/90 and even high-normal blood pressure (between 130/81 and 139/89 mmHg) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (Lewington et al., Lancet. 360:1903-13, 2002; Vasan et al. N Engl J Med. 345:1291-7, 2001).</p>  <p>Essential hypertension is a multifactorial disease with local vascular endothelial dysfunction, alterations in renal function, changes in cardiac and neural control of the circulation all contributing. There is considerable expertise in these related areas in the University of Florida with groups with national reputations, many of whom are already collaborating and the University of Florida is also the home of the National Vascular Biology Working Group, chaired by Dr. Pepine, Cardiology Division Chief, <a href=""http://www.vbwg.org/"">http://www.vbwg.org/</a>.</p>  <p>The research projects fall within the general area of endothelial control of cardiovascular function. The program is organized around the following major overlapping themes (see figure) that reflect the faculty expertise: Endothelial repair, Neural control of vascular tone and BP, Angiotensin II control of BP, Nitric oxide control of BP, Pulmonary hypertension, CV damage in renal disease, Exercise and CV injury and health.</p>"		http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n8237468		thing;uf;center;agent;org	Integrated Electronics Center					http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n1278118								http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n8237469		thing;uf;center;agent;org	Center for Intelligent Machines and Robotics		http://cimar.mae.ufl.edu/CIMAR/			http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n1278118								http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n824623		thing;uf;center;agent;org	Center for Film Studies and Media Studies		http://www.film.ufl.edu/			http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n8858828;http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n47689						"The Center for Film and Media Studies offers courses in the history, aesthetics, and theory of film, video, and new media.

Critical to our mission is the timely dissemination of information to policy makers, providers and advocates.</p>  FCMU: Health Services Research and Vulnerable Populations  <p>FCMU serves as a campus-wide home for researchers and analysts interested in issues related to access to quality health care for Florida's vulnerable populations. This is important for two reasons. A focus on vulnerable populations is particularly important in our state. In Florida, children and adults have significantly lower rates of employer-sponsored health insurance and higher rates of uninsurance relative to national averages. Florida's demographic makeup is among the most racially and ethnically diverse in the country creating a strong demand for a culturally and linguistically competent healthcare workforce. The state's population is aging rapidly, placing an increasing burden on the long-term care system. In addition, as the federal and state budgets grow tighter, Medicaid will face significant cutbacks in service and in enrollment. Lessons learned in Florida will have implications for the nation as a whole.</p>  FCMU's Role in Florida Health Care  <p>The Center advances its mission in a number of ways. First, the Center will actively pursue grants and contracts from national foundations and agencies to support the work of UF health services researchers interested in underserved populations. Second, the Center serves as a resource to the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) for the study of issues pertaining to state health policy. In this regard, the Center engages in a contractual arrangement with AHCA to research issues that pertain to the development of policy options for Florida Medicaid. The Center will also draw on existing research expertise within the university. For example, the <a href=""http://www.bebr.ufl.edu/"">Bureau of Economic and Business Research</a> in the College of Business currently provides survey support to the Center. The dissemination of data, findings, and policy options to stakeholders is a key element of the Center's work. In addition to publication in major health services research journals, the Center produces and distributes its work in forms that appeal to policymakers. These include policy papers, issue briefs and fact sheets. The Center also holds periodic meetings and forums that engage Florida's lawmakers, their staff, and other advocates in meaningful health policy debates. Critical to the expansion and sustainability of health services research is the development of younger researchers and analysts. The Center is be committed to serving as a research base for graduate students interested in low-income and vulnerable populations.</p>"		http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n987238		thing;program;uf;agent;org	Forensic Science Distance Education Program		http://www.forensicscience.ufl.edu/			http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n237306;http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n466110
