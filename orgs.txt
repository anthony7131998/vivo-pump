The overall focus of the faculty and students is improving the practicing engineer's ability to produce accurate components in a timely manner; this has important ramifications for both the private and defense sectors. Our approach is to perform fundamental research in support of this goal, while taking care to consider the practical implementation of our research efforts. Through this combined agenda, the center trains students from the high school to graduate levels to have strong analytical/numerical modeling capabilities coupled with good experimental techniques and data analysis skills.</p>  <p>While the historical focus of the MTRC has been macro-scale manufacturing applications, with the addition of new faculty and facilities, new activities in the micro- and nano-scale domains are underway. This multi-scale manufacturing approach matches the current climate within the industry which demands expertise at all length scales. We also recognize that manufacturing in the 21st century requires knowledge in many areas, including structural dynamics, optics and photonics, precision design, heat transfer, and metrology ('the science of measurement'), in order to develop process models and improve efficiency. An important example is the increased use of high-speed machining to produce discrete components in the aerospace, automotive, and biomedical industries from the micrometer to meter scales. This remains a cornerstone of our research efforts.</p>

Thanks to strong support from the University, outstanding faculty and strong international collaborations, we are well on our way to achieving this goal. We have partnered with astronomers in Spain and Mexico to build the world's largest optical telescope, the GTC. This 10.4-meter telescope has been constructed in the Canary Islands and has begun operation in 2009. The superb image quality allows the GTC to "see" both the faintest and the most distant objects in the universe, from nearby, newborn planets and stars, to the most distant galaxies.</p>  <p>The formation and evolution of planets, stars and galaxies is the major unifying research theme of our department, and we are pursuing that theme through related observational, theoretical and instrumentation research programs. Our partnership with Spain and Mexico has led to the development of new instruments that will be used to achieve the research goals of the department, such as CanariCam, FRIDA (Infrared Adaptive Optics Integral Field Unit) and CIRCE (Canarias Infrared Camera Experiment). UF astronomers are also partners in GOYA, a major near-infrared spectroscopic survey to be carried out on the GTC to study galaxy formation and evolution. In addition, UF has implemented a very successful program to bring Spanish graduate students and young postdocs to acquire expertise in astronomical research and, in particular, astronomical instrumentation.</p>  <p>In the coming years, the Department of Astronomy is continuing to grow and broaden the research opportunities at the University of Florida. Several key initiatives are already underway. For instance, UF is playing a key role in the development of instrumentation for the proposed $1-billion Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project. A team of nine UF faculty, led by Professor Stephen Eikenberry, have been competitively selected to develop detailed scientific observation simulations and designs for the top-priority science instrument on TMT, the InfraRed Multi-Object Spectrograph (IRMOS). IRMOS will be the workhorse spectrograph for TMT, and will be the world's most powerful tool for investigating many astrophysical phenomena, including "Cosmic Dawn," the birth of the first stars after the Big Bang. At the other end of the research spectrum, Professor Jian Ge and Professor Eric Ford are leading the next steps in planet searching with the All-Sky Extra-Solar Planet Survey (ASEPS). ASEPS will use a number of Exoplanet Tracker instruments developed at UF to find hundreds to thousands of new planets around nearby stars, revolutionizing this area of study.</p>  <p>Through our programs, partnerships and future endeavors, the University of Florida's Astronomy Department is on an upward trajectory of distinction that we believe is limited only by our imagination.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>		
http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n108182		agent;thing;academicdepartment;department;org;uf	Philosophy		http://web.phil.ufl.edu/			http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n8858828						<p>What is Philosophy?</p>  <p>Philosophy addresses foundational questions. These are questions the answers to which inform our basic understanding of one or another domain of inquiry, or some fundamental aspect of the world or ourselves or our relation to the world. Philosophical inquiry is therefore not restricted to any particular subject matter. In this respect, it is different from every other subject studied at the university. What characterizes a philosophical question is not what it is about, but at what level it is pitched. The best way to give a sense of this is to consider some examples.</p>  <p>Some of the simplest questions we ask about things are also the most fundamental and the most difficult to answer. For example, in the philosophy of time, one of the simplest, yet most puzzling questions, is &lsquo;What is time?&rsquo; St. Augustine gives a lively sense of the difficulties in the&nbsp;<i>Confessions</i>&nbsp;when he says,</p>  <p>What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not.</p>  <p>There are many things we say about time: that time is ordered, that there are past, present and future times, that time passes, that where there is no passage of time, there is no change, and so on. But many things are ordered, spatial points, for example. Talk of the past, present or future already evidently presupposes an understanding of time. Talk of the passage of time provides no insight because it employs a metaphor of motion which cannot be taken literally. While a cart may pass by, it makes no literal sense to say time does because it does not move. One may live through interesting times, but not in the way one passes through a landscape. Change is intimately bound up with time, but the passage of time is not the only thing necessary for change, for where there are no things there is no change either, though things that change are not times. Change takes place in time, but not in time in the way a change may take place in a room or in an object. The more one thinks about time, the more puzzling it becomes. It is a deep question, what time is, though it takes but three words to ask it.</p>  <p>To say that philosophy addresses foundational questions is not to say that other subjects don&rsquo;t. For example, &lsquo;What is time?&rsquo; is also a question of some importance in the foundations of physics. Foundational questions can be raised in any discipline. When the questions go deep enough, they are philosophical in character. The questions go deep enough when their answers fix at least in part the range of variation of empirical theories still recognizably about a subject matter. When one asks foundational questions, the usual methods of a discipline for answering questions in the domain of study are often of little help. This is because the usual methods typically presuppose answers to various foundational questions and so can&rsquo;t be used when one is addressing them. Philosophy is the only discipline as such which is concerned with general methods for addressing foundational questions.</p>  <p>Though foundational questions arise in every particular discipline taught at the university, not every foundational question falls in the domain of one of the disciplinary subjects. This is often because they cut across disciplines or cannot be easily located in the usual taxonomy of university subjects. These are the sole province of philosophy. For example, the three fundamental questions of the theory of knowledge, &lsquo;What is knowledge?&rsquo;, &lsquo;What do we know?&rsquo;, &ldquo;How do we know it?&rsquo;, are not the province of any particular disciplinary subject matter. Every particular subject, physics, biology, history, psychology, linguistics, and so on, aims at knowledge of its domain, presupposes that we have knowledge of some things in it, and that there are methods for acquiring more. But the study of knowledge in general falls outside the scope of any of them. This is not to say that the study of knowledge, what we know, and how we know it, is not important in the various disciplinary subjects, but that when one turns to study it, one is not studying something specific to the discipline. One is no longer just doing physics, biology, history, etc. Similarly, the basic question of ethics, &lsquo;How ought one to live?&rsquo;, does not fall in the domain of any disciplinary subject. Yet it is a most fundamental and urgent question, which scarcely any reflective person can get through life without asking at some point. And it is, like many philosophical questions, a peculiarly difficult one. You cannot answer it by seeing how people do live. For there is no inconsistency in living in a way one ought not to, and, indeed, for most or even all people not living in the way they ought to live. In answer to it, we want a norm or ideal which we can hold up to ourselves a guide for life, a standard to aspire to and which can provide a correction if we are off course. The attempt to understand this question leads to many others. For example, what is the difference between a normative and a descriptive claim? What is morality? What is the source and power of its claims upon us? How is it balanced against other considerations? What is the role of reason in answering the question what one ought to do? Is it an objective matter or in some sense subjective?</p>  <p>While these are only some of the many questions that are addressed in philosophy, they are characteristic of the kinds of questions that philosophy asks. Philosophy has a long history and the discussion of many of these basic questions has a long history as well, and their discussion has come to have a formidable sophistication&mdash;as in any subject with a long intellectual history in response to its basic questions. But the starting points are immediately accessible, and the method has been the application all the powers that reason can bring to bear and improve upon through critical reflection. We may sum it up then by saying that philosophy is the systematic application of reason to the most fundamental questions across the entire range of human inquiry.</p>  <p>Philosophy then is one the purest and at the same time one of the broadest of the intellectual disciplines. Its concerns are abstract, general, and fundamental. It has connections with all other subjects both because it is concerned with their foundational issues and because it is concerned with foundational issues that cut across all of them, and indeed with foundational issues with human life in general. While not an easy subject, it is both tremendously valuable and rewarding. It tends to attract students who cannot help asking themselves basic questions about things that most people take it that they understand without having given them any thought. If you study philosophy seriously for any length of time, it changes how you think about everything. The world grows both more complex and simpler.</p>  <p>The traditional divisions of philosophy are these: ethics, logic, epistemology (the theory of knowledge), metaphysics, and the history of philosophy. Ethics we have characterized above as the study, most generally, of what one ought to do. Logic is the study of valid argumentation, and so a methodological study. Epistemology is the study of knowledge and related matters. Metaphysics is a kind of catchall category for much of the rest of philosophy, but includes centrally the study of ontology, that is, of what things there are and their natures at the most general level, for example, events, objects, abstract and concrete, universal and particular, states of affairs,&nbsp;<i>possibilia</i>, and the like. It also includes the study of general notions such as those of identity, truth, causation, space and time, necessity and possibility, and various sub-disciplines such as the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind. The history of philosophy bears a special relation to philosophy in that a proper and deep understanding of the history of discussion of philosophical problems is important for a proper understanding of their contemporary treatment. There are many more areas of philosophy, for example, the philosophy of science, aesthetics, social philosophy, and the philosophy of mathematics. There are many interconnections between all of these areas as well, as the study of really fundamental questions in any area is apt raise questions in others. For example, just about every philosophical inquiry will at some point run up against fundamental questions in epistemology.</p>  <p>A more extended discussion of philosophy and its nature, origins and divisions, can be found in section 1 of the&nbsp;<a href="http://vivo.ufl.edu/ugmhbk.html">Philosophy Majors Handbook</a>.</p>  <p><br /> <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br /> <!--[endif]--></p>  <p><i>Prepared by the&nbsp;<a href="http://web.phil.ufl.edu/">Philosophy Department</a>&nbsp;at the University of Florida. &copy; 2007</i>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>

Guided by a motivational model of emotion, which proposes that an appetitive motive system mediates pleasant affect and a defense motive system mediates unpleasant affects, the Center?s research goals are to elucidate the functions and mechanisms of the defense system, as it determines human fear and anxiety.</p>  <p>The CSEA has been an NIMH Center for Behavioral Science Research since September 1994. Dr. Peter J. Lang is the Center Director, and the main administrative site is located at the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The broad aim of the Center is to study emotional stimulus processing in all its directly measurable manifestations, i.e., as affective report, behavior, and patterns of expressive physiology (facial, visceral, and neuromuscular), and to understand the relation of these processing measures to functional changes in the brain. An important further aim is to study the interaction of emotional reactivity with attentional demands as attention is modulated by stimulus characteristics, motivational state, and the behavioral and social context. A theoretical model of emotion and motivation, based on neuroscience research with animals, guides analyses of human affect. Connecting links are sought through human electrocortical and brain imaging (fMRI) studies.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>In addition to its own research projects, the Center provides broad services to the field, developing stimulus materials and advancing laboratory technology, training research apprentices, fostering scientific communication, and generally facilitating emotion studies within this country and internationally. The Center investigators have a special concern with translational research in the moving of basic scientific knowledge on emotion into the mental health arena. Thus, there is a subfocus on maladaptive emotional states, characterized by exaggerated intensity or persistence, as in the anxiety disorders, and on the converse condition, apparent deficit in emotional responding, as in psychopathy.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>

Founded in 1946, the Department of Religion is the second oldest religion department among Americas&rsquo; public universities and one of the strongest. We have a distinguished and diverse faculty, who together offer a rich and diverse curriculum to a growing number of students.</p>  <p>Our undergraduate major examines religion as a significant and pervasive element in human culture. Emphasis on method and theory and religion&rsquo;s comparative dimensions enables students to read and critically analyze current literature. Our graduate program builds upon department, college, and university strengths while staking out new areas of inquiry within the discipline of religious studies. The Religion in the Americas program draws on UF&rsquo;s strong&nbsp;<a href="http://www.latam.ufl.edu/Research/index.stm">Latin American Studies</a>&nbsp;program to focus on North, Central, and South American religious interactions. Religion and Nature critically explores the relationships among human beings and their diverse environments, cultures and religions. The program in Religions of Asia emphasizes the transmission and interaction of Asian religious traditions and peoples as they move across and beyond Asia.</p>  <p>The department is also home to several important initiatives.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.clas.ufl.edu/chitra/index.html">The Center for the Study of Hindu Traditions</a>, established in 2005, is the only program of its kind in the nation to encourage the research, teaching, and public understanding of Hindu culture and traditions.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.religionandnature.com/journal/index.htm">The Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature, and Culture</a>&nbsp;provides a forum for international research on religion and nature. Departmental faculty and students also participate in many interdisciplinary programs across UF&rsquo;s campus and beyond.</p>  <p>Vasudha Narayanan<br /> Chair&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>

The agricultural industry served by the center has an annual farm gate value of $834 million.&#160; Multiplier effects make agriculture's impact on the local economy worth over $1 billion annually.&#160;</p>  <p>Due to the region's   humid subtropical climate, <strong>TREC</strong> is the only state university research center in the continental U.S. focusing on a large number of tropical and subtropical crops. Also, the area's oolitic limestone soil is unique to extreme southern Florida.&#160; In addition, the Center addresses water and environmental issues that impact crop production over a shallow aquifer and in proximity to Everglades National Park, Biscayne National Marine Park, Florida Bay and major well fields which provide drinking water to the several million people in neighboring urban areas.</p>  <p>The center's 160 acres consist of offices, laboratories, greenhouses, vegetable fields, and fruit orchards. There are sixteen faculty members and about 45 support staff.</p>

There are broad sub-specialties within aquatic medicine which include care of captive marine mammals, care of pet fishes, zoo and aquarium species, aquaculture medicine, and clinical research involving free-ranging aquatic species. Specialty training incorporates aspects of clinical medicine, wildlife health, environmental science and engineering.</p>  <p>Aquatic animal health specialization requires substantial training and experience beyond the four year veterinary degree, and may include graduate school, internships, and in some cases, residency training. Currently, there is a specialty certificate in aquatic medicine which can be earned through board certification by the <a href="http://www.aczm.org/aczmmain.html">American College of Zoological Medicine</a>. There is also a certificate in fish pathology which can be earned through the <a href="http://www.fisheries.org/units/fhs/certific.htm">American Fisheries Association</a>.</p>  <p>The aquatic animal health program at the University of Florida includes the marine mammal health program operated through the College of Veterinary Medicine and the <a href="http://150.176.130.202/">Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience</a>. It is funded by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Also included is a strong program in fish and aquaculture medicine which is run through the <a href="http://fishweb.ifas.ufl.edu/index.htm">Program in Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</a>, in the School of Forest Resources and Conservation.</p>  The aquatic animal health program has activities in all academic areas which are part of the University of Florida&rsquo;s land grant mission. Our unique teaching program offers <a href="http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/extension/aquatic/education/#aahc">certification</a> to veterinary students allowing them to pursue specialized training and clinical experience in aquatic animal health while still in veterinary school. Our <a href="http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/extension/aquatic/education/#degrees">graduate education program</a> provides training in marine mammal science and aquaculture health with opportunities available at both the M.S. and PhD level. We also offer a unique <a href="http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/extension/aquatic/education/#Residency">clinical residency program</a> which is fully accredited by the American College of Zoological Medicine. In addition, we offer opportunities for public education under the auspices of IFAS Cooperative Extension Service. These include evening seminars for the public, workshops for aquaculturists and pet fish hobbyists, a regional marine mammal conference which is offered every third year, and a full suite of continuing education <a href="http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/extension/aquatic/education/#courses">short courses</a> in both fish and marine mammal medicine. Finally, the aquatic animal health program has a strong <a href="http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/extension/aquatic/research/">research</a> area. Areas of excellence include Florida manatee research, emerging diseases, viral diseases, sea turtle pathology, and aquaculture medicine. A clinical program run by Dr. Mike Walsh includes response to stranded marine mammals as requested by colleagues, and several clinical contracts in the region. <a href="http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/extension/aquatic/support/#aquaculture">Diagnostic services</a> for aquaculture clients are available through the Program in Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences.

The hospital has sophisticated diagnostic imaging capabilities, modern surgical suites, an intensive care unit and a spectrum of cutting edge technologies, all of which are important in the diagnosis and treatment of difficult and complex diseases in your pet. All of our clinicians are recognized specialists and the well being of your pet is their top priority.</p>  <p><strong>What to Expect</strong></p>  <p>After checking in with our receptionist you will be seated in the waiting room and a veterinary student will greet you and your pet and escort you to an examination room to record the medical history and perform an initial examination. Time spent with the student will be followed by an additional consultation with one of our clinicians. All observations and impressions will be discussed with you, including the estimate of charges for diagnostic tests and treatment(s).</p>  <p><strong>The Medical Team</strong></p>  <p>A dedicated team of people will be working with you and your pet during your visit to our hospital. The team consists of board-certified specialists; residents and interns (graduate veterinarians undergoing additional training in a specialty area; veterinary students (working under the direct supervision of our faculty); veterinary nurses who perform tests and help with treatments; and animal care technicians, caring for and feeding our patients.</p>  <p><strong>Clinic Visit</strong></p>  <p>Because of the educational aspect of our hospital and the complexity of the many problems seen here, we emphasize thoroughness in evaluating each animal presented to us. Physical examinations, client interviews and the performance of various tests generally take a little longer than a normal office visit. During this time we will try to identify your pet's problem and discuss the diagnostic and treatment options with you.</p>  <p><strong>Hospitalization</strong></p>  <p>After our examination one of our recommendations may be hospitalization, either for additional diagnostic tests or specific treatment. We have 24-hour staffing to provide optimum medical care and if your pet is critically ill, it will be admitted to our intensive care unit. During the time that your pet is with us, you will be provided with at least a daily progress report. You will also be notified immediately if the condition of your pet changes significantly. For this reason, it is important that we obtain your home, mobile and work phone number(s).</p>  <p><strong>Visiting</strong></p>  <p>Some owners wish to visit their animals while they are hospitalized. These visits are sometimes helpful but need to be coordinated with the attending clinician and are limited to specific times.</p>  <p><strong>Intensive Care</strong></p>  Our intensive care staff provides the highest quality of critical care medicine for our seriously ill patients. Our staff is highly skilled and their efforts are continuously backed up by our clinicians.

The WRRC administers funding provided through the federal Water Resources Research Act of 1984 and coordinates water-resources research and technology transfer as authorized by the funding, acts as liaison for Florida Agencies and water management districts, promotes water-resources research by seeking external support, and seeks to enhance the state and national image of the University of Florida (UF) as a focal point for water resources research.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>History</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>In 1995, the Water Resources Research Center (WRRC) was re-established as a separate entity from the combined Center for Wetlands and Water Resources Research. Historically, since 1964, the WRRC as a separate or combined center has been a university-wide focus for water- resources research and has served as the Water Resources Center for the state of Florida. The mission of the WRRC is to serve as a center of expertise in the water resources field, assist public and private interests in the conservation, development, and use of water resources, provide opportunities for professional training, assist local, state, regional, and federal agencies in planning and regulation, and communicate research findings to interested users. The WRRC administers funding received from the federal Water Resources Research Act of 1964 and coordinates water-resources research and technology transfer as authorized by the funding, acts as a liaison for Florida agencies and water management districts, promotes water-resources research by seeking external support, and seeks to enhance the state and national image of UF as a focal point for water resources research. The WRRC is funded in part by Section 104 of Public Laws 98-242 and Public Law 104-99, which are administered by the U.S. Geological Survey, Department of Interior. Additional funding and support are provided by UF and research sponsors that include state agencies such as the water management districts and the Florida Geological Survey.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Research sponsored by the WRRC is conducted by faculty and students at UF and other state universities. Research is conducted in areas of water resources that include groundwater flow and contaminant transport, surface-water flow and transport, and water- resources management. Projects have included determining the impacts of well field development on Cypress Creek near Tampa, describing the water resources of the Kennedy Space Center, studying the movement of hazardous contaminants in groundwater systems, enhancing wetland storage and storm water recharge in south Dade County, and developing a methodology for socio-economic assessment that was applied to Lake Apopka.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>

The Department provides instruction in the Greek and Latin languages and literatures, as well as course work in English translation dealing with archaeology, civilization, Egyptology, history, mythology, religion, linguistics, literary genres, medicine, athletics, and the status of women. Over 800 students per year work to fulfill their language requirements in Latin or Greek, while many hundreds more take courses in English translation to meet General Education guidelines. Thus we serve a wide constituency of students ranging from those who wish to specialize in ancient languages to those who desire a general background in the Graeco Roman world as a foundation for a liberal arts education.</p>  <p>With approximately 90 majors and 93 minors according to the latest figures from the Registrar, UF has one of the largest undergraduate classics programs in the nation. For most the major is an end in itself: a basic liberal arts degree from which they proceed to business or teaching careers, professional schools (e.g., law and medicine), while others pursue graduate level study in classics, linguistics, history, religion, or philosophy. The Department's M.A. program has two tracks, leading either to further work at other institutions towards the Ph.D. in classics, or to teaching Latin in the high schools, where there is now a critical shortage of teachers. Institutes each summer for the state's high school Latin teachers help them meet recertification requirements and broaden their knowledge of the field. Some high school teachers earn their M.A. in Classics through summer study.</p>  <p>The Department's eleven full time tenure track faculty, three lecturers, one visiting professor, and two adjuncts have diverse research interests, including archaeology, art history, ancient athletics, linguistics, drama, the ancient novel, oratory and rhetoric, historical writers, women's studies, the poetic genres, and modern Greek literature. As a core humanities department, Classics cooperates with other programs, such as Religion, Philosophy, History, Linguistics, Art History, Women's Studies, Honors, English, and the other literature departments.</p>  <p>The Department is seriously committed to excellence in scholarly research. In the past five years, classics faculty have published 8 books, and 43 articles in major refereed journals. Research is emphasized for the vigor, life, and new information and methodologies it infuses into our teaching, as well as its intrinsic value of extending our knowledge of classical civilization, and thereby, indirectly, the understanding of our own. The Department also views service to the state of Florida as a very serious component of its mission, primarily through training secondary school teachers.</p>

The programs of the Institute are designed to deepen and broaden the thinking of participants and policy leaders and to aid them in making decisions that will enhance the future of our state.</p>  <p>Within this general framework, the Askew Institute has three goals: 1) to gather thoughtful men and women around a table to converse with one another about the critical issues of the day; 2) to explore the past for insights into the future; and 3) to assist leaders of the state in meeting the needs of the citizens of Florida. It is the aim of the Institute to address important issues in a politically non-partisan environment and against the backdrop of history. We do not intend to develop public policy or legislative goals. As an independent organization without political affiliation, the Institute seeks to enhance the quality of leadership in the state and to provide an opportunity for Floridians from all walks of life to think about the future needs of Florida.</p>

It draws upon specialized knowledge and skill in the mathematical, physical, and social sciences together with the principles and methods of engineering analysis and design, to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems.</p>  <p>At the University of Florida, we define Industrial and Systems Engineering as a discipline concerned with the design and application of analytical methods to the analysis, design, and optimization of systems. The tools used include statistics, simulation, engineering methods, mathematical modeling, and optimization. True to our roots, we take these tools one-step further and implement our solutions with the use of algorithms, databases and user interfaces. After all, solutions are only useful when implemented.&nbsp;</p>

Harrell, Jr., M.D.</a> , founding dean of the University of Florida College of Medicine, envisioned a student oriented educational program in a multidisciplinary health center. His goal of educating the health team to care for patients in their communities has timeless significance. He believed their education must be patient centered, always aware that patient care will forever be an art resting on a scientific base. This center is dedicated to continuing Dr. Harrell's vision.</p>  <p>Guided by Dr. Harrell's vision, the University of Florida College of Medicine created The Harrell Professional Development and Assessment Center to provide a suitable environment for learners to acquire the techniques and tools necessary for successful evaluation and treatment of patients.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>  <p>The Harrell Center encompasses a suite of 16 patient examination rooms equipped to resemble outpatient clinic rooms, emergency cubicles, and hospital rooms.&nbsp; There are 16 adjacent computer carrels, two conference rooms, a reception area, and an audiovisual control center. The patient rooms, each equipped with two closed circuit, color video cameras and a microphone, are linked to the control center.</p>  <p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, imagine the power of video. Think of its potential to communicate and motivate, to educate and inform. The state-of-the art, custom designed audiovisual system housed in the control room provides the ability to capture, record, display and replay important interactions. Eight monitoring stations, each capable of displaying video from up to four separate patient rooms at one time, are situated in the control room for observation and instruction.</p>  <p>To achieve quality audio recording, careful attention was given to obliterating the extraneous and sometimes unnoticed sounds in the normal environment. All rooms in the assessment center are sound isolated to eliminate distracting noise.</p>  <p>Direct observation into some of the patient rooms can be gained through a one-way window from the central hallway. One of the conference rooms doubles as an observation theater for group demonstrations, as one of the patient rooms can be directly observed from the conference room via a large one-way window. Viewers can also observe the student/patient interaction at one of the eight monitoring stations in the control room.</p>  <p>The Harrell Center houses an exciting, unique educational&nbsp; resource&mdash;the standardized patient program. Standardized patients are individuals trained to simulate signs and symptoms of specific ailments or who have stable, abnormal physical findings. Students or residents interact with a standardized patient just as they would with an actual patient to take a history, perform a physical exam, counsel and educate the patient, or negotiate a treatment plan. This encounter is monitored by video camera and/or observed through a one-way window. The interaction can also be recorded for later feedback. Small groups of six or more students and a teacher can work with standardized patient problems in tutorial sessions. Unlike real patients who may be too sick for repeated examinations, the standardized patient is readily available to reproduce the exact behaviors and symptoms of an illness over and over for self-paced learning or evaluation of students' clinical skills.</p>

IHEPA serves to facilitate collaborations of UF researchers in large scale projects in the interdisciplinary area of Particle Physics and Astrophysics. Many of the Institute's participants are involved in national and international experiments, including the CDF experiment at FermiLab, the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) at Cornell University, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), the experiment searching for Gravitational Waves in space (LISA), the CMS experiment at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, the axion search at Livermore National Laboratory, search for cold dark matter particles (CDMS), and the MiniBooNE neutrino oscillation experiment at Fermilab. Small groups of researchers from UF have taken active roles in the primary activities of these experimental efforts. Their activities include designing and constructing new apparatus in collaboration with outside groups, developing major software components, carrying out data analysis and simulation, and providing large scale computing support for data reduction and simulation, a task for which we are particularly well equipped. The High Energy group is particularly active in development of the GRID technologies for distributed computing which will be used for data analysis in CMS, LIGO, and other experiments.

Johnson, M.D., former J. Robert Cade Professor, C. Craig Tisher, M.D., former Dean of the College of Medicine at the University of Florida and editor of the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, and the late Robert Cade, M.D., inventor of Gatorade&reg;.</p>  <p>The Nephrology, Hypertension, and Transplantation Division at the University of Florida has the major mission of providing outstanding clinical care in a setting of extensive basic and clinical research and training programs.</p>  <p><strong> Clinical Program</strong></p>  <p>The Division provides outstanding medical care for subjects with new onset and/or complicated hypertension, diabetic kidney disease, glomerulonephritis, acute and chronic renal failure, and renal transplantation. Patients entering the clinics are not just offered routine medical care but are invited to participate in clinical studies searching for the cause and or cure of their disease. The plan is to develop NIH Centers of Excellence in Hypertension and Renal Disease. The dialysis patients managed by the Division exceed national and local standards for the quality of their dialysis and the unit boasts one of the lowest mortality rates in the country. Two new dialysis centers recently opened. The transplantation program currently led by Dr. Meier-Kriesche as the Medical Director, is a state-of-the-art program utilizing the most efficacious and safest immunosuppressive regimens.</p>  <p><strong> Education Program</strong></p>  <p>The Division has an ACGME-certified training program in nephrology as well as a National Institutes of Health Training Program (T32) to provide exceptional training for the fellow who wants to enter into a career in clinical nephrology and/or a career in academic medicine in the field of nephrology, hypertension or transplantation. Under the directorship of Dr. Zvi Talor we have developed a high-profile education program for the residents and medical students. The program has a history of exceptional teaching as evidenced by the fact that the most popular clinical nephrology textbook worldwide is co-edited by a faculty member (&lsquo;Comprehensive Clinical Nephrology&rsquo;, eds Richard J Johnson and John Feehally, Harcourt, 2003, 2nd edition) and that the extremely popular Nephrology and Hypertension for House Officers is edited by the prior chief and past Dean, Dr. C. Tisher (Nephrology Handbook).</p>  <p><strong>Research Contributions</strong></p>  <p>The Division has a long history of major contributions to the field, heralded by the introduction of physiologically based solutions to treat sports-related dehydration by the late Dr. Robert Cade (former Chief), leading to the invention of Gatorade, and to the discovery of one of the major cell types in the kidney involved in the excretion of body acids by Dr. CC Tisher (former Chief and past Dean). Current research is focused on identifying the cause and future cure of essential hypertension (Dr. R J Johnson), identification of critical transport mechanisms involved in kidney acid and ammonia regulation (D Weiner and C Wingo), the key role for the vasculature in mechanisms involved in kidney failure (M Segal, R J Johnson), studies to prevent hypertension and kidney disease in African Americans (R Johnson, CC Tisher and M Segal), ways to predict and prevent rejection of the kidney transplant (H-U. Meier-Kriesche and S. Rehman), and understanding the mechanism of increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease and lupus (M Segal). The Division boasts over 1 million dollars direct yearly support by the NIH and other institutions with over 30 publications per year. Dr. Johnson (Director) has been invited to give a state of the art in past years for his societies. In addition, we inaugurated the Robert Cade Lectureship in Internal Medicine with Dr. Don Seldin as the first Cade Professor and with a celebration in Dr. Cade's honor on January 15th, 2004 and we also launched the CC Tisher Visiting Professor lecture series with Dr. Eberhard Ritz as the first Tisher Visiting Professor in early March 2004.</p>

The renowned embryologist, James G. Wilson, Ph.D. was appointed the first Chairman by Dean George T. Harrell, Jr.</p>  <p>Some years later, the department was merged with the Department of Pathology and subsequently a division of Anatomical Sciences in the Department of Pathology was created and led by Michael H. Ross, Ph.D. In 1976, the department&rsquo;s name was re-established to Department of Anatomy and continued with its traditional orientation and areas of teaching/research emphasis until sweeping changes in the entire biomedical research arena began to pull apart the monolithic basis of the traditional preclinical disciplines. One of the reasons for this change was the proliferation of many research-oriented professional societies, such as those of cell biology and neurosciences. The change in the name of our department to Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology more than 10 years later was a reflection of these trends.</p>  <p><strong>A Modern Cell Biology Department</strong></p>  <p>The faculty of the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology are involved in a variety of educational and research endeavors, with the majority of research focused on topical problems in cell biology, developmental biology, and molecular biology. In 1999, our department moved to an &lsquo;Open Laboratory&rsquo; concept with approximately 8,000 sq. ft. in the Basic Science Building. A cold room, a photographic facility with an X-ray film processor and microscopy suite are adjacent to the open laboratory. In addition, the open laboratory has a central computer graphics facility. The department also has ties with the UF Shands Cancer Center, the UF Genetics Institute, The McKnight Brain Institute and the Aging and Geriatric Research Institute. Core modules, cell/tissue culture/Immunology, structural biology, and molecular genetics are in place.</p>  Our department&rsquo;s graduate program is part of the college&rsquo;s interdisciplinary graduate program (IDP) in biomedical sciences leading to the Ph.D. in medical sciences with specialization in the following concentration of molecular cell biology. The aim of the Molecular Cell Biology advanced concentration is to provide a comprehensive and flexible course of study leading to the Ph.D. degree. The prime objectives are to provide the students with a broad foundation in molecular cell biology and prepare students to conduct creative and independent research in a specialized area.

The knowledge acquired in this transformative process has an intrinsic value to the university and its students. As such, we have a four-fold mission:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. to conduct research at the graduate and faculty level in the languages, literatures and cultures of the world, including linguistic and media studies, and communicate original results that relate these domains;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. to facilitate the study of languages, literatures and cultures at the undergraduate level in such a way that students actively engage with this field of knowledge;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. to connect North American and international perspectives on academic endeavors in the humanities, and to maintain an international voice and presence at the University of Florida; and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. to promote the integrity of our component academic fields and to support the vitality of each of the programs housed in the department.<br /><br />By cultivating the potential inherent in combining both national and transnational approaches in a single entity, the department advocates an inclusive and interdisciplinary scholarship that develops innovative models, both theoretical and pragmatic, for the study of languages, literatures, and the various media that comprise our understanding of culture.

It is a multi-discipline research and extension center located in Hardee County. Founded in 1941 through the efforts of legislators, cattlemen and citizens, the research center has 2840 acres of native and developed pastures, and approximately 1200 head of cattle. It has seven research and extension faculty and 22 support staff. Two thirds of Florida's cattle are located in the southern half of the state. The research program at the Range Cattle REC is designed to serve the cattle industry in this portion of the state, although it involves a cooperative effort on important statewide problems. Cattlemen in south Florida are facing constantly changing economic and production challenges. This unique subtropical environment provides direct and indirect impacts on the beef and dairy industry. Direct impacts include climatic, water table, and soil influences on forage and animal production; and associated disease and insect problems. Indirect impacts include potential use of by-products from other agricultural industries as animal feeds and environmental quality.</p>  <p>Mission Statement</p>  <p>The purpose of the Range Cattle Research and Education Center is to conduct research and provide information that will solve problems related to improving profitability of beef, forage and field crops, and dairy production in central and south Florida. Emphasis will be placed on developing new information that can be used immediately by these industry groups. A limited number of basic studies will be conducted to identify the best means of solving problems and to expedite the development of applicable information. The Range Cattle REC faculty will work closely with industry representatives and IFAS research and extension personnel to accomplish this mission. Research plans are developed with careful consideration of industry problems identified by cattlemen advisory groups, the Florida Cattlemen's Association Research Committee, and extension personnel throughout Florida.</p>

http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n4777232		thing;uf;center;agent;org	William R. Maples Center for Forensic Medicine		http://maples-center.ufl.edu/			http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n166017						<p>The William R. Maples Center for Forensic Medicine is a joint initiative of the Colleges of Medicine and Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Florida. It was created in 1999 by the Board of Regents to honor the memory of Dr. William R. Maples, an internationally recognized pioneer in the field of forensic anthropology.</p>  <p>Mission Statement</p>  <p>The mission of Maples Center is fourfold - Education, Research, Service, and Outreach. The Center utilizes its extensive expertise in forensic medicine to provide comprehensive services and innovative programs that relate to medicolegal death investigation. Multidisciplinary integration of services, technologies, training, and research address contemporary forensic issues. The Center has the responsibility of maintaining central laboratories for diagnostic anthropology and toxicology including the examination and diagnosis of forensic cases for local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, medical examiners, and attorneys. Educational programs are provided to law enforcement, medical examiners, and other healthcare professionals throughout the state. The Center has plans to develop a graduate program in forensic medicine.</p>  <p>Rationale</p>  <p>Forensic sciences at the University of Florida had been distributed between two major laboratories (The C.A. Pound Human Identification Laboratory and the Diagnostic Referral Laboratory) and a number of other departments including pathology, anthropology and entomology. These laboratories and the various sub-units have been integrated into the Maples Center resulting in several advantages. The Maples Center is the first center in the State University System focused on Forensic Medicine. It uniquely provides medicolegal capabilities for education, research, service and outreach for the benefit of university students and faculty, forensic science professionals, local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, and citizens of the State of Florida. The Maples Center works cooperatively with other programs to integrate cross-disciplinary knowledge in all areas of the forensic sciences.</p>  <p>Activities</p>  <p>The Maples Center creates an exciting exploratory environment for approaches and perspectives that transcend traditional forensic science research and education. It focuses scholarship, policy and methods development across all available media, scales, and systems to create new educational, research, service, and outreach opportunities in Forensic Medicine. The Maples Center is organized as a collaborative network that encourages and coordinates multi-disciplinary scientific inquiry among its community of scholars and practitioners. New educational opportunities have been developed and provided to the novice as well as the forensic professional. Rotations in forensic anthropology and toxicology will be advertised and accredited with the governing bodies of national societies. Medical students, residences and fellows at the C.A. Pound Human Identification Laboratory have completed successful rotations over the past two years. The Maples Center encourages partnerships at all levels with internal and external scholars, practitioners, communities, institutions of governance and law enforcement in order to advance the forensic sciences. Maples Center activities address societal problems locally, in the State of Florida, nationally, and internationally.</p>  <p>In addition to maintaining the research and service missions of the Maples Center, another goal is the development of a graduate program in Forensic Medicine at the masters and doctoral levels that are not presently available in the SUS. Currently, the SUS offers the masters degree in forensic sciences at the University of Central Florida. This program focuses on developing an expertise in fire and explosives, and thus chemistry is their primary educational unit. There is no program in the State of Florida, other than the Maples Center, with an emphasis on forensic medicine. The Maples Center unifies the existing programs (anthropology, pathology, chemistry, nursing, and others), and creates a much requested degree tract. All educational programs, workshops, and international symposia sponsored by the Maples Center are of exceptional quality in order to attract the best scholars at every level to bring fresh and multi-faceted approaches and insight to the widest range of contemporary medico-legal issues. The Center has been tasked with the development of the Florida Emergency Mortuary Operations Response System (FEMORS) by the Florida Department of Health in conjunction with the State's Division of Emergency Operations. The Center has developed a state-oriented plan including training for use in a mass fatality incident. For more information on FEMORS visit <a href="http://www.femors.org/">www.femors.org</a>.</p>  <p>Education</p>  <p>The Maples Center was established to expand existing programs in anthropology and pathology to include specializations in forensic toxicology and anthropology. Several new courses are being added to the current curriculum in the departments of Anthropology and Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, Nursing, and other health-related fields. For example, additional courses specific to anthropology include quantitative research methods in forensic anthropology, forensic osteology, archaeological methods in forensic anthropology, and anatomy for physical anthropologists. Similarly, new courses in toxicology include analytical methods in forensic toxicology and principals of pharmacology and toxicology for forensic toxicologists. These courses would be open to all graduate students and advanced undergraduates, and would serve to compliment present training in anthropology and toxicology at the University of Florida.</p>  <p>An introductory course in forensic medicine has been developed and is currently offered through the Department of Anthropology. This course is being offered to all interested undergraduate students, and is cross-listed by anthropology, criminology and pathology and laboratory medicine. Other courses are being developed and faculty has been identified to present these courses as early as Spring 2004. In addition, Founding Faculty from departments across campus will present courses in their areas of expertise (e.g., forensic engineering, forensic radiology, human biomechanics, and environmental medicine) to fulfill elective requirements in the formal degree programs.</p>  <p>Training and outreach education are coordinated with basic and applied research in order to make a substantial contribution towards meeting state and national needs for broadly trained forensic scientists, teachers, technicians, and professionals. The Maples Center's educational programs will support the mission of the University of Florida and the SUS to provide citizens of the State of Florida with the broadest possible benefits and opportunities for the future.</p>  <p>Research</p>  <p>The Maples Center will enable researchers from diverse fields across campus to collaborate on projects that will address contemporary issues in forensic medicine. There are many new and exciting areas of research currently being examined by partners in the Center. The UFDRL Forensic Toxicology Laboratory and the C.A. Pound Human Identification Laboratory are attempting to discover the preservation rate of illegal substances such as cocaine and heroin in human bone. A proposal examining the utility of ground penetrating radar to contemporary forensic anthropology issues is being prepared for submission to UF and the U.S. Department of Energy, and reflects collaboration between Anthropology and Soil and Water Sciences. New areas of research in forensic medicine are being examined which include developing a digital graphic database of skeletal lesions and trauma, three-dimensional graphical interfaces, and use of improved methods of non-invasive data recording of soil stratigraphy. The large 35mm micrographic library of the C.A. Pound Human Identification Laboratory is currently being preserved via digital scanning. The production of a CD ROM library is being proposed to several resources. It will make this library and graphic interface available as an educational and reference software package. Three-dimensional graphic facial reproduction and the aging processes are new technologies, which are under development with Paul Edwards, M.D., Department of Surgery, UF. A meeting with the Center for Missing and Exploited Children (Washington, DC) has been held, and we are proposing research with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine to capture the necessary data for production of software applicable to missing children who have aged. This application is a much-needed tool in the law enforcement field. The C.A. Pound Human Identification Laboratory has been in the forefront in the development and use of facial reconstruction on skeletal materials (and on synthetic reproductions), as well as video-superimposition of photographs of subjects and cranial remains. These procedures are useful in identification of missing or unknown persons, and also identification of crime suspects (e.g., current photo with surveillance camera photo). These procedures will be continued, and constantly evaluated and improved with the greater capabilities afforded through the William R. Maples Center for Forensic Medicine. Other projects include using magnetometers and infrared to improve searches for clandestine graves. Future collaborations between graduate students and founding members will be facilitated by the incorporation of the Maples Center into the program of graduate studies at the University of Florida.</p>  <p>The Center is developing a web-based database to merge data on missing, exploited, and endangered persons, with data from unidentified human remains from the State of Florida. FL-RAPID will serve all 23 medical examiner districts and law enforcement agencies in the state. Data will be integrated with information maintained by FCIC and NCIC. Medical examiner offices and criminal justice systems will have access to the database. The Center is seeking funding for the expansion of FL-RAPID. Merging FL-RAPID with other existing databases and adding a DNA component are future goals.</p>  <p>Service</p>  <p>The training of forensic specialists, medical examiners, and law enforcement personnel is accomplished by the organization and presentation of accredited courses at various times throughout the calendar year. The presentation of courses provides automatic feedback to Maples Center faculty. This comes in the form of evaluations of materials presented as well as critique of teaching methods. Moreover, interactions with practicing forensic scientists provide course instructors the opportunity to develop new research themes based on current issues in the forensic sciences. This creates a continuous loop between forensic practitioners, researchers, and academicians. Faculty and center members are able to use the resources of the Maples Center to offer topical programs lasting from one day to multi-week residential courses. The staff of the Maples Center will serve as course-directors in the planning, advertising, budgeting, and staffing of these courses. The need for topical courses in crime-scene recovery, toxicological methods, forensic anthropology, and other innovative forensic methods has been repeatedly called for by Florida's Medical Examiners, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and various local law enforcement agencies. These courses are being advertised nationwide to attract students from all regions of the country. The University of Florida has excellent resources, facilities, and faculty to make these offerings successful ventures. Both Center Directors have prior experience as course directors for accredited courses in the U.S. and Internationally.</p>  <p>Outreach</p>  <p>Lectures and programs in the various fields of forensic medicine are available to the surrounding community. Founding members of the Maples Center and their students are available to the Gainesville and University Police Departments, Sheriff's departments and associations and will cooperate with their ongoing community programs. Several founding members of the Maples Center are working in the community in various activities, and incorporating their energies more broadly into such programs. The C.A. Pound Human Identification Laboratory has been working with superior officers in the Gainesville Police Department in their victims awareness programs, and their cold-case coalition. Additional activities include the participation of anthropology faculty in the development of health maintenance facilities for the Eastside of Gainesville.</p>

The Center is committed to working in close cooperation with the Baldwin Library to help raise public awareness of the contents of this remarkable collection.</p>		
http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n4777234		thing;uf;center;agent;org	Center for Medieval and Early Modern Studies		http://www.clas.ufl.edu/mems/			http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n8858828						<p>Medieval and Early Modern Studies (MEMS) at UF is an interdisciplinary forum for the study of medieval and early modern European culture and its influences on the modern world. This approach addresses the distinctive forms of cultural organization in the Middle Ages and Early Modern periods; the study necessarily crosses departmental boundaries.</p>  <p>The IDS major in MEMS enables students to obtain knowledge about the values, interests, world views, and technologies of medieval and early modern communities (e.g., monastic, chivalric, peasant, early urban), and to familiarize themselves with some of the world's greatest epic and lyric poetry, drama, and romances. Students are encouraged to draw on their knowledge for historical perspectives that can contribute to current discussions on such issues as ethnicity and nationality, colonialism, technologies and their effects, constructions of gender and sexuality, the characteristics of historical and fictional narratives, and so on. MEMS recommends itself to students who are seeking a major that involves textual analysis, critical thinking, and creativity, and who want to take an active role in the shaping of their curriculum. Since it provides a well-rounded liberal arts education rather than specialized training, the IDS major in MEMS is excellent pre-professional preparation for a wide range of careers, including law, medicine, library science, journalism, government service, and teaching.</p>  <p>The faculty of MEMS consists of award-winning teachers and internationally recognized scholars. MEMS at UF sponsors an annual Spring symposium, <a href="http://vivo.ufl.edu/edit/carnival.shtml">Carnival!</a>, and benefits from its association with <a href="http://www.english.ufl.edu/exemplaria/">Exemplaria: A Journal of Theory in Medieval and Renaissance Studies</a>.</p>

The distinguished <a href="http://www.medicine.ufl.edu/gastro/gastro_faculty.asp">faculty</a> have a major commitment to teaching and research in addition to their clinical activities. The University of Florida Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition is consistently identified as one of the top 3% Gastroenterology Units in the country by US News and World Report. There is a 20-bed inpatient digestive and liver disease service at <a href="http://www.shands.org/">Shands Hospital</a> that cares for patients with liver diseases, liver transplants, gastrointestinal and pancreatic diseases. A hyperalimentation metabolic support service, directed by the Division, provides the enteral and parenteral hyperalimentation consultations to&nbsp;all patients at Shands Hospital. The Division runs consultation services at Shands Hospital and the <a href="http://www1.va.gov/directory/guide/facility.asp?ID=54&amp;dnum=All">Veterans Affairs Medical Center</a>. There are state-of-the-art computerized video endoscopy suites at both Shands Hospital and the Malcom Randall VA Medical Center. The endoscopy suites regularly perform upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and therapeutic endoscopic procedures. A number of special procedures including biliary manometry, endoscopic removal of bile duct stones, biliary and pancreatic duct stent placement, esophageal stent placement, achalasia dilation, botulinum toxin injection therapy of achalasia, enteroscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, and laser therapy of GI neoplasms are performed on a daily basis.</p>  <p>There is a unique gastrointestinal diagnostic laboratory for specialized testing, not often found at other medical centers. Studies include pancreatic secretory tests, 14C and 13C xylose breath tests for detecting bacterial overgrowth, Helicobacter pylori breath tests, serum trypsin levels, and an array of manometry procedures to assess gastrointestinal motility. These capabilities attract patients to the medical center from all over the United States.</p>  <p>The medical center has an active liver transplant program. Shands Hospital at the University of Florida is one of the top 10 most active liver transplant programs in the country. <a href="http://shands.org/hospitals/uf/service/transplant/liver/transplantliver.asp">UF Liver Transplantation Page.</a></p>  <p>Extensive outpatient activities are conducted by the faculty of the Division in outpatient clinics. Each clinic is organ or disease-related so that referring physicians can easily select a date on which they want their patient with a digestive, liver, or nutritional disorder to be evaluated. <a href="http://www.medicine.ufl.edu/gastro/gastro_clinic.asp">Refer a patient to be seen in the GI/Liver clinic.</a></p>

We offer BA and BS undergraduate degrees and MA, MS and PhD degrees in Geography. Faculty and graduate student research interests fall under three broad headings of Economic Geography, Physical Geography and Resource Management. Within these, individual interests include, business geography, care of the elderly, housing and regional and international development. Human interaction with the physical environment provides the focus for our work in climatology, geomorphology, hydrology, land use and tropical agriculture. We also possess excellent facilities for teaching and research in the technical fields of GIS, remote sensing, and cartography. There are strong ties on campus with the interdisciplinary Center for Latin American Studies and the Center for African Studies, to which many faculty are affiliated. The department plays a leading role in the Land Use Environmental Change Institute (LUECI) and is a partner with the School of Natural Resources and Environment. We have an impressive number of award-winning teachers, and all are committed to providing a challenging education, research, and public service.

It was established in January 2000 to oversee the development of bridge related software products at UF. The goals of the BSI include enhancement, maintenance, and dissemination of bridge software to address the increasing demands on the transportation industry. The BSI also anticipates the future needs of the nation-wide transportation community in the digital environment, by the development and promotion of the Data Interchange for Geotechnical and GeoEnvironmental Specialists (DIGGS) and the design of a corresponding DIGGS database. The BSI is also dedicated to providing technical assistance with the software under the Institute's auspices.  <p>We place particular emphasis on high fidelity computational modeling and its application in advancing the basic computational methods to tackle new scientific challenges on new generations of large scale bridge engineering problems. The thrust of institutional research activities is the development of powerful computational codes and their application to the solutions of large scale bridge engineering problems through inter-disciplinary research and development in collaboration with the Structural/Geotechnical Research Groups in the Department of Civil and Coastal Engineering at the University of Florida. One of the main strengths of the institute and one for which it is nationally recognized, is in nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis and its applications to solving large-scale extreme event problems.</p>  <p>Since 2003, the BSI has developed a robust database system that integrates the application of geotechnical engineering data and associated metadata which enables the construction of services in the digital environment. The FDOT Database System is now being used in large-scale implementations, with more applications under development. The BSI is also leading in the DIGGS project. DIGGS is a coalition of government agencies, universities and industry partners whose focus is on the creation and maintenance of an international data transfer standard for transportation related data. The coalition came into existence through coordination with the U.S. Federal Highway Administration who sponsored meetings and eventually formed the pooled fund study project.</p>  <p>This unique intellectual and creative combination of academia, government, and industry energizes the work of our faculty, staff, and our students. As BSI moves further into the 21st century, I expect the institute to continue to succeed and to produce new generations of robust engineering software and thus to provide reliable engineering resolution to the community of bridge engineering in the world.</p>

The Center was established to provide the philosophy and structure to link UF's Cultural Plaza (the Harn Museum Art, the Phillips Center for Performing Arts, and the Florida Museum of Natural History) with campus arts programs and other programs that relate to public policy issues thereby bringing the arts into the mainstream of the university community.</p>  <p>The purpose of CAPP is to provide a forum for the discussion and analysis of arts and public policy issues. Such issues may include, but are not limited to, the arts in education, public funding for the arts, the economic impact of the arts, "percentage for arts programs," patronage systems, the health hazards of artists' materials, copyright laws, cultural diplomacy, etc. <br /><br />The Center is the catalyst for courses in the arts and public policy offered through UF Colleges of Fine Arts; Business; Liberal Arts and Sciences; Law; Design, Construction and Planning; and the Health Sciences Center. Since CAPP was founded, it has originated, sponsored, and co-sponsored a variety of symposia with the College of Fine Arts; College of Law; Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art; Phillips Center for the Performing Arts; the City of Gainesville, Department of Cultural Affairs; the School Board of Alachua County; the Santa Fe Community College Department of Creative Arts and Humanities and the Santa Fe Gallery of Art; and the Atlantic Center for the Arts. These symposia have included "Censorship and Obscenity in the Arts: Public Attitudes/Legal Problems," "Multiculturalism and Political Correctness: Implications for the Arts," "Controversial Public Art: The Legal and Ethical Dimensions," "Art in Public Places: Controversy or Consensus," "Art and Healing," "Culture and the Livability of Communities," "empowering Women through the Arts," "Collaborative Efforts: Art, Science, and the Issue of Bio-Diversity," and the "Health Hazards of the Artists Materials and Environments." <br /><br />Because the future of the arts is always uncertain and the political winds ever changing, CAPP continually engages in ongoing projects such as exploring the funding of culture in a bottom line-driven society, the ever-present problems of artists' health, and the legal and ethical implications of the arts in academe.</p>

The three units now occupy a new multi-million dollar research and education facility on land next to the old Apopka center.</p>  <p>The original units of MREC were established at various times to address industry concerns:</p>  <p><strong>Apopka - 1968 </strong> - Conduct research on environmental horticulture crops in the areas of nutrition, water use, breeding, plant pathology, entomology, economics and general plant culture.                                                                        &nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Leesburg - 1929</strong> - Conduct research on vegetable and fruit crops in the areas of breeding, plant pathology, entomology, developmental biology and horticulture.                                                                        &nbsp;                         <strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Sanford - 1933</strong> - Conduct research on ornamental plants, vegetable crops on sand and organic soils and ecology of midges. Research areas include plant pathology, horticulture and entomology.</p>  <p>Today, however, industry and urban concerns about the environment have led to a melding of industry and urban needs which have contributed to the need for the unit's consolidation. The total MREC staff of about 77 including 15 faculty focus on agricultural research to address crop production, environmental plant use in urban communities, and effects of midges on Florida life-styles.</p>

The Research and Education Center facilities are located on a 320-acre tract of land and include: 17,000 square feet of administrative and laboratory space, research greenhouses, and maintenance facilities. Currently, 30 acres are in use for vegetable research and 70 acres for citrus (20 developed and 50 under construction). Additionally, 150 acres are used as a native range/scrub jay preserve and include a 30-acre water reservoir.</p>  <p>Initially established as the South Florida Field Laboratory in 1955, the Center began investigating the principal crops of watermelons, tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet peppers, and squash. In addition to research on vegetable production, nutritional and variety tests of improved and native forage crops were conducted. In the 1980s, the rapidly expanding citrus industry in Southwest Florida caused the Center to also focus research in that area. By 1988, a fully developed research and extension program for citrus was added. All of this work continues today as the SWFREC strives to:</p>  <ul>  <li>Develop new and expanded existing knowledge and technology related to vegetable, citrus, beef, and sugar cane production to allow Florida agriculture to remain efficient and economically competitive with other geographic areas of the world.</li>  <li>Assist the Cooperative Extension Service, UF/IFAS campus departments, and other research and education centers in extension, educational training, and cooperative research programs for the benefit of Florida producers, students, and consumers.</li>  <li>Determine benefits of cover crops and land application of non-hazardous wastes to crop production.</li>  <li>Efficient use of fertilizer and water in citrus, vegetable, and sugar cane production.</li>  <li>Define and seek solutions to problems associated with newly planted and young citrus trees in the flatwoods of Florida and the propagation and production of citrus nursery trees.</li>  <li>Develop a systems approach for the utilization of vegetable transplant production and direct seeding for efficient stand establishment.</li>  <li>Improve utilization, production, and quality of native range.</li>  <li>Investigate and develop water quality management practices useful to agricultural producers in meeting changing government requirements, and undertake regional monitoring programs toward identifying trends and priorities.</li>  <li>Develop economical and environmentally sound management practices to limit the insect and disease damage to crops in Southwest Florida.</li>  <li>Utilize the Integrated Resource Management (IRM) approach to assist the livestock industry of Florida to achieve efficient production by contributing to the solution of livestock production problems.</li>  </ul>

Housed in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, our center emphasizes interdisciplinary work and the study of Global Hindu traditions. We focus on the fields of art, architecture, Asian languages and literatures, philosophy, performing arts, healing, women&rsquo;s studies, and the environment, as well as on water, gender and social justice issues,.&nbsp; Our center brings together experts from across UF&rsquo;s campus and creates a network of scholars working in Hindu Studies in Florida to collaborate on research, create new course offerings, and host lectures, seminars, symposia and conferences.</p>  <p>Through the activities of CHiTra, the study of Hindu traditions &nbsp;transcends its traditional boundaries in one or two departments and is being integrated into mainstream academic study across the campus. We &nbsp;study its rich heritage not just in India, but in many parts of the world including South East Asia, the Americas, the Caribbean and Africa, and explore its expansion into a transnational phenomenon.</p>  <p>The center enriches the understanding of Hinduism both within the academic community and among the general public. In time, we seek to create opportunities for interdisciplinary interaction and co-operation between scholars of the Hindu tradition from around the world and scholars in other disciplines and fields.</p>  <p>In today&rsquo;s ever changing global environment, CHiTra seeks to enhance public appreciation of the Hindu tradition by reaching out to the community through sponsored art exhibits and dance and musical performances in collaboration with UF&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.arts.ufl.edu/">College of Fine Arts</a> and the <a href="http://www.harn.ufl.edu/">Samuel P.

http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n8237466		thing;uf;center;agent;org	Hypertension Center		http://www.hypertension.ufl.edu/			http://vivo.ufl.edu/individual/n1466923641						<p>This is a new T32 funded by NHLBI to support 3 predoctoral trainees and 3 postdoctoral trainees. The aim is to produce independent basic and clinician scientist investigators who are capable of developing and sustaining top quality research programs studying cause, treatment and prevention of hypertension and associated cardiovascular injury using a wide range techniques. By introduction of the trainees to a wide range of scientific disciplines during the training period, we intend to produce young scientists capable of multidisciplinary research; essential for understanding a complex disease such as hypertension.</p>  <p>There is clear need for future hypertension researchers, given the epidemic of hypertension in the US with over 65 million adults known to have hypertension in 1999 to 2000. Further, hypertension is now the single major cause for a doctors visit or for prescription of medications. Given the fact that the population is living longer and becoming more obese, a rapid further increase in incidence of hypertension is anticipated (Fields et al.,Hypertension. 44:398-404, 2004). As blood pressure increases in middle and old age, there is a strong and direct relation to vascular (and overall) mortality. In fact the risk is present at blood pressures even below the cutoff for hypertension, 140/90 and even high-normal blood pressure (between 130/81 and 139/89 mmHg) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (Lewington et al., Lancet. 360:1903-13, 2002; Vasan et al. N Engl J Med. 345:1291-7, 2001).</p>  <p>Essential hypertension is a multifactorial disease with local vascular endothelial dysfunction, alterations in renal function, changes in cardiac and neural control of the circulation all contributing. There is considerable expertise in these related areas in the University of Florida with groups with national reputations, many of whom are already collaborating and the University of Florida is also the home of the National Vascular Biology Working Group, chaired by Dr. Pepine, Cardiology Division Chief, <a href="http://www.vbwg.org/">http://www.vbwg.org/</a>.</p>  <p>The research projects fall within the general area of endothelial control of cardiovascular function. The program is organized around the following major overlapping themes (see figure) that reflect the faculty expertise: Endothelial repair, Neural control of vascular tone and BP, Angiotensin II control of BP, Nitric oxide control of BP, Pulmonary hypertension, CV damage in renal disease, Exercise and CV injury and health.</p>

The chemical senses is a recognized field of academic endeavor that inherently encompasses a wide variety of disciplines and transcends traditional academic boundaries, making fostering research and training in the chemical senses an especially appropriate mission for a Center.</p>  <p>The Center presently integrates the activities of 55 faculty together with their postdoctoral associates and graduate students from 22 different departments spanning 6 different Colleges, the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, the Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience, the US Department of Agriculture at UF, and the US Veteran&rsquo;s Administration at UF. Through integrating the broad expertise at the University of Florida relevant to chemical senses research, the Center is positioned to make a unique contribution to the field, to the University, to Florida industry (citrus-derived chemicals are a major source of revenue for the flavor and fragrance industry), and to the health of Florida&rsquo;s citizens.</p>  <p>The Center reports fiscally to the Provost and administratively to the Vice President for Research. This organizational structure positions the Center to optimally address a field of endeavor that spans the traditional organizational units of the University. The Center is affiliated with the McKnight Brain Institute, which provides the physical home for the Center.</p>  A new multidisciplinary approach to research in the chemical senses...  <p>Modern scientific discovery is being led by integrating concepts and technologies from diverse disciplines. The University of Florida - with its diverse academic expertise, including its health sciences faculty, on a single, integral campus - is especially well positioned to ride this wave of progress. Fostering multidisciplinary research is among the cornerstones of President Machen's plan to elevate the University into the top tier of public universities. By integrating the University's broad scientific knowledge to address questions in the chemical senses, the Center is pioneering an exciting new approach to understanding how we smell and taste.</p>

In addition, The UF Center strives to increase awareness and understanding of HIV through leadership, service and education, with the ultimate goal of decreasing the transmission of HIV.</p>  <p>History</p>  <p>The UF Center began providing medical care for children in 1988. Over the next two years the growing need for additional HIV/AIDS research became apparent. In 1990, The UF Center established a four-year partnership with the National Cancer Institute in order to participate in clinical research trials. During this partnership, the center explored the barriers children face in finding, receiving and maintaining health care. This led to the center's current comprehensive approach to care, providing "one stop" complete care for patients.</p>  <p>In 1993, the center became a National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Unit. In 1995 and again in 1999, the center received an "Excellence in Health Care Award" for its success as an HIV/AIDS program. The center continued to grow and in 1997 moved to the newly renovated clinic space it currently resides in at Shands Jacksonville. In this same year, the center expanded its scope to a family-centered, comprehensive health care provider for HIV/AIDS infected or exposed infants, children, adolescents, women and their families.</p>

The Emerging Pathogens Institute will fuse key disciplines to develop outreach, education, and research capabilities designed to preserve Florida&#8217;s health and economy, and to prevent or contain new and re-emerging diseases.The purpose:  <p>To establish an Emerging Pathogens Institute (EPI) by fusing signature disciplines at the University of Florida and creating opportunities for novel scientific interaction.</p>  The objectives:  <ul>  <li>Develop the research capability to be prepared to prevent and contain outbreaks of new diseases that threaten Florida. </li>  <li>Develop the teaching capability to train the next generation of scientists who will keep these pathogens at bay in the future. </li>  <li>Develop the outreach capability to educate the people of Florida on steps they can take to avoid human diseases as well as help our private sector avoid diseases that affect plants and animals. </li>  The problem:  <p>Florida's residents and its two major industries, agriculture and tourism, are threatened by new diseases that enter Florida including West Nile virus and citrus greening.&#160;Other diseases not yet in Florida are an even larger threat such as avian flu in humans and hoof and mouth disease in cattle. Florida's unique geography and climate require unique disease prevention and control strategies.</p>  Why is Florida particularly vulnerable?  <p>Florida's wide array of temperate, sub-tropical, tropical ecosystems and its diverse agriculture are particularly vulnerable to new pathogens that thrive in our mild climate.&#160;Recent hurricanes allow disease agents to appear and reappear from the Caribbean and Latin America simply by being wind-borne. Over 76 million tourists each year and commercial plant imports from around the world have the potential to unwittingly carry pathogens to our state from other countries.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  </ul>

Critical to our mission is the timely dissemination of information to policy makers, providers and advocates.</p>  FCMU: Health Services Research and Vulnerable Populations  <p>FCMU serves as a campus-wide home for researchers and analysts interested in issues related to access to quality health care for Florida's vulnerable populations. This is important for two reasons. A focus on vulnerable populations is particularly important in our state. In Florida, children and adults have significantly lower rates of employer-sponsored health insurance and higher rates of uninsurance relative to national averages. Florida's demographic makeup is among the most racially and ethnically diverse in the country creating a strong demand for a culturally and linguistically competent healthcare workforce. The state's population is aging rapidly, placing an increasing burden on the long-term care system. In addition, as the federal and state budgets grow tighter, Medicaid will face significant cutbacks in service and in enrollment. Lessons learned in Florida will have implications for the nation as a whole.</p>  FCMU's Role in Florida Health Care  <p>The Center advances its mission in a number of ways. First, the Center will actively pursue grants and contracts from national foundations and agencies to support the work of UF health services researchers interested in underserved populations. Second, the Center serves as a resource to the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) for the study of issues pertaining to state health policy. In this regard, the Center engages in a contractual arrangement with AHCA to research issues that pertain to the development of policy options for Florida Medicaid. The Center will also draw on existing research expertise within the university. For example, the <a href="http://www.bebr.ufl.edu/">Bureau of Economic and Business Research</a> in the College of Business currently provides survey support to the Center. The dissemination of data, findings, and policy options to stakeholders is a key element of the Center's work. In addition to publication in major health services research journals, the Center produces and distributes its work in forms that appeal to policymakers. These include policy papers, issue briefs and fact sheets. The Center also holds periodic meetings and forums that engage Florida's lawmakers, their staff, and other advocates in meaningful health policy debates. Critical to the expansion and sustainability of health services research is the development of younger researchers and analysts. The Center is be committed to serving as a research base for graduate students interested in low-income and vulnerable populations.</p>
